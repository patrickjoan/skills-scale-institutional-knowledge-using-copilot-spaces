# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (facilitated by **PM**, attended by **PdM**, **Developers**, **QA**, and relevant specialists)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by **PdM** with input from **Business Analyst** and **Stakeholders**)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points, facilitated by **Scrum Master** if available)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) (agreed upon by **Developers**, **QA**, **DevOps**, and **Technical Writer**)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (coordinated by **PM** with input from **DevOps** and technical leads)
6. Create release plan and milestone map (developed by **PM** with **PdM** and **DevOps**)

For detailed role responsibilities in planning activities, see the [RACI matrix in Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).
